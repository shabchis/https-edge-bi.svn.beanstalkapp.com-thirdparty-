Under the DemoProjects folder you will find several sample projects, both in
VB.Net and C# for both Visual Studio 2002/2003 and Visual Studio 2005. The
sample projects demonstrate some of the basic features of the DataStreams
components for several supported file formats, including CSV, XLS, XLSX, XML,
and fixed width. The sample projects require no configuration and can be ran
immediately after opening the solution file for the project inside Visual
Studio. Additional code samples can be found online at
http://www.csvreader.com/csv_samples.php and in the forums at
http://groups.google.com/group/CSVChat/ .

The component documentation is in the file DataStreams Documentation.chm in
this folder. If this file does not seem to open correctly, make sure that
the properties of the file in Windows XP is not restricting the functionality
by right clicking on the file, choosing properties, and on the General tab
there should be a security option at the bottom that can be disabled for the
file. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/902225 for more information.
Documentation can also be viewed online at http://www.csvreader.com/csv/docs/ .
